  ## Description
  Created a simple text editor app that can function both online and offline. The application looks to use the data in the indexedDB to populate the editor, then if it cannot access that it will use local storage. For use offline, this application can be downloaded to your desktop as an application. This application is helpful to developers because they can use this as a scratch pad for code snippets and coding ideas. User story is below. 
  
  AS A developer
  
  I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
  
  SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
  
  ## Installation
  npm install
  ## Usage
  To use this app, simply open it up in the browser and then you are good to go. For offline use, the user can go to the link and hit the "install" button at the top left corner of the page.
